## The R Horror Show

Don't get me wrong I like R but sometimes it drives me crazy!

### Substracting 1,2 from a matix

The following example took me two days (mostly since I did not spot the error):

```{r}
M = matrix(rep(c(1,2),3), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
M
```

I want to substract 1,2 from each column. So the result should be a zero matix:

#### First solution

```{r}
M - c(1,2)
```

#### Substracting a column vector

```{r}
cv = matrix(rep(c(1,2),3), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
cv
M - cv
```

#### Using Apply

This is the easiest solution I came up with

```{r}
t(apply(M, 1, function(x)x-c(1,2)))
```
